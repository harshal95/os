Implemented ps command in C

option_processor.c is the C file with main(). It calls the other modules:

1. read_options.c to get user input
2. get_proc.c to read a process under /proc directory and add it to a linkedlist3. info_parser.c reads the stat and statm file for every process and displays the output

node_structs.h contains structs needed for storing and accessing process information
Used getopt to parse options from user
Used readdir to read /proc directory
