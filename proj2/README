Implemented shared memory producer/consumer problem in C using semaphores
.c and .h files are in code directory
mainProgram.c is the file that has the main(). It does the following:
	1. Creates three queues
	2. Creates reader, munch1, munch2 and writer threads
	3. Waits for the threads to terminate and then prints queue statistics and exits
Queue.c handles synchronized queue operations
reader.c handles operations to be performed by reader thread
munch1.c handles operations to be performed by munch1 thread
munch2.c handles operations to be performed by munch2 thread
writer.c handles operations to be performed by writer thread
